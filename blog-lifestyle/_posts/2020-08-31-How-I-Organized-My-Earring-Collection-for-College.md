I’m going to be honest, I am usually not the most organized person. However, while I was packing up my things for college, I decided that this year I was going to try to be more organized and make sure that everything in my room had its place. One of the things I knew I really needed to keep organized this year was my earrings; admittedly, I have way too many. So, while I was packing I devised a system for organizing my jewelry. The key for me was sorting my earrings out based on size, color, and function.

I chose to keep all of my gold earrings together in one place because they pair well with most outfits. These earrings typically function as “everyday” earrings for me, so they live on a small elephant shaped jewelry dish which I can easily access.

When organizing this display, I made sure to put smaller earrings inside of bigger earrings so it would be easier to see each of them on such a small dish. I also tried to spread out my earrings as much as I could, so that I wouldn’t have to dig to find the earrings I wanted to wear.

After gathering my gold earrings, I sorted through my jewelry collection until I found all my silver earrings, which I don’t wear very often. Since I normally prefer gold jewelry, I only wear these earrings when my outfit would look better with silver.

I then located all of my “classy and timeless” earrings and put them in a pile. These are the earrings that I would typically wear to a fancy dinner or to an important event. They also happen to be earrings with sophisticated prints or materials (pearls, leopard print, black jewels) that will probably never go out of style. I ended up not bringing all of these earrings to college because my mother made most of the pearl earrings and I didn’t want to lose them.

After sorting my earrings into the aforementioned groups, I was left with a bunch of fun, colorful earrings. These are earrings that I would normally wear to parties or fun events, so I kept them in one large group.

At home, I’d probably store each group of earrings in a separate plate, but for college I only packed 2 earring displays (the small elephant shaped dish and a large white platter with a bunny on it). Because of this, I displayed most of my earrings on the white platter. I put my largest, most delicate earrings on the bunny ears, and spread out the rest of my earrings on the plate. I made sure to keep each group separate by leaving space in between the groups on the platter. I also arranged the group of colorful earrings in the order of the rainbow. For all of the groups, I put smaller earrings inside of bigger earrings in order to save space and be able to easily access them. When I was done organizing my jewelry, I put both jewelry platters on top of my dresser.

And here’s what my earring display looks like all together:

I will be posting a dorm room tour in the next couple of weeks, so stay tuned to see how the rest of my room comes together!
