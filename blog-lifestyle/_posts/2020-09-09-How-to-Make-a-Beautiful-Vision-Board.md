During fall, I love to bring pieces from the 70’s into my wardrobe because I think they are really flattering and they’re also very trendy. But instead of just showing you guys fall outfits that I normally wear, I’ve decided to step out of my comfort zone a bit and try to create some new outfits inspired by a few characters on one of my favorite TV shows: “That 70’s Show”. 


<p class="lst-item">1. Jackie Burkhart</p>

A lot of my friends say I remind them of Jackie Bukhart, so I figured I’d start off with some Jackie-inspired looks.

When creating looks that mimic Jackie’s style, I started with the accessories. Jackie usually wears a scarf, so I selected one of my scarves from my wardrobe and built the outfit around it; I ended up picking a floral scarf because Jackie is known for wearing floral print clothing. Jackie tends to match the colors of her accessories to other elements of her outfit, so I picked out a blue top to go with the blue scarf. I specifically chose a bell sleeved top because it is reminiscent of the 70’s. I decided to wear flare pants for the same reason. While Jackie usually wears blue denim pants, I went for orange corduroy pants to give a bit more texture and color to the look. To pull this look together, I belted it with a brown snake print belt and then slipped on some black heels.

For my second Jackie-inspired outfit, I started with Jackie’s go to hairstyle: bangs pulled to the side with some cute clips. Unfortunately, I didn’t have clips that went with this outfit, so I used some cute white hair ties that I got from Anthropologie instead. I wanted to really capture Jackie’s feminine style in this look, so I paired a red pleated skirt with a white blouse (which matched the hair ties, of course). To complete the look, I added heels and gold hoop earrings, which are featured in my post on <a href="https://iwalte01.github.io/fashionisa-blog/How-I-Organized-My-Earring-Collection-for-College/"> jewelry</a>.

<p class="lst-item">2. Steven Hyde</p>

While Hyde has a lot of cool outfits on the show, I decided to model my outfits after Hyde’s more casual looks because they were easier to replicate with the wardrobe I have at college.

Hyde usually wears a t-shirt with a rock band on it, but I didn’t have one at college, so instead I chose to wear bold graphic t-shirts for these looks. For the first look, I layered my t-shirt over a white long-sleeved shirt; for the second look, I simply put on a white graphic tee. Hyde always wears jeans, so I decided that flare jeans would be appropriate for this outfit. Although I didn’t belt this look, I think it would look really good with a thick brown or black belt, just like Hyde wears on the show. Hyde’s signature accessory is aviator glasses, so I made sure to incorporate these to create a finished look.

<p class="lst-item">3. Donna Pinciotti</p>

And last, but not least, a Donna inspired outfit!

Donna is always wearing a bandana, so I used my bandana as the foundation for my outfit. I think that bandanas pair really well with denim, so I decided to include denim flare pants in this look. Donna also wears denim jackets a lot, and if I had brought one that matched the pants to college, I would have layered it over my top. Speaking of my top, I purposefully chose one with multicolored stripes because the green stripes provide a seamless transition from the cool colored pants to the (mostly) warm colored shirt and orange bandana. This look wouldn’t be Donna-inspired if it didn’t include heeled loafers; I added some brown ones.

If you would like to find your own 70s styles, take these ideas and run with them!
