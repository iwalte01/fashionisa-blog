A couple of weeks ago, I created a post about <a href="https://iwalte01.github.io/fashionisa-blog/I-Tried-to-Make-Flavored-Boba-from-Scratch-and-Here's-What-Happened/">making boba tea</a> and announced that I was starting a series of blog posts called “Isa Tries It” in which I try new things and post about them. This week, I started online classes, and I was having a lot of trouble getting excited about school since it wouldn’t be the same as last year. I had heard that vision boards were a good technique for motivation, so I thought I’d try making one about my goals and wishes for 2020-2021 and sharing my process and results with you all.

Personally, I like making collages, and if I wasn’t living in a college dorm I probably would have just torn out some images from magazines and crafted the vision board by hand. Since I am stuck in my room with no magazines floating around, I decided to make my vision board using Pinterest. The great thing about creating vision boards on Pinterest is that it doesn’t take long to put the board together, and it’s easy to access from my laptop when I’m doing online assignments and need some encouragement. 

When designing my vision board, I thought of 4 main categories that I wanted to include on the board: 

<p class="lst-item">1. Quotes I Live By </p>

For this category, I searched for quotes on Pinterest that represented my values and what kind of person I want to be this year.

This is actually a quote one of my friends recently sent to me via text, and I love it because it reminds me how important it is to think for myself and create my own path instead of letting other people have too much influence over me. I purposefully made this quote the cover of my Pinterest vision board so that I remember to be more self-reliant and to make creating my dream life my top priority.

<p class="lst-item">2. Goals </p>

When adding goals to my vision board, I searched for images that symbolized what I want to achieve this year. For example, one of my goals is getting a computer science related summer 2021 internship in NYC, so I added images like these to my board:

<p class="lst-item">3. Travelling and Food </p>

Covid-19 might still be going on, but a girl can dream, right? I decided to still include places I want to travel to in 2021 (NYC, Boston - actually going into the city, Japan, Hawaii etc.) on my board just in case a vaccine comes out. I also included food I am hoping to eat when I travel to these places.

<p class="lst-item">4. Outfit Inspiration and Aesthetics </p>

As a fashion blogger, how could I not include fashion in my vision board?! There are a lot of aesthetics and outfits that I want to try out this year, so I added my favorite Pinterest outfits to my board. I also added some other aesthetic images to pull everything together and make my board a bit more stylish.

I didn’t do much to organize the board since it’s already in order of most to least recently pinned images. I especially like this format because it shows my thought process as I added to the board. The only thing I really did in terms of organization was rearranging some images into similar color schemes to be more aesthetically pleasing.

You can find my whole vision board on my <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/isawalters140651/">fashionisa Pinterest</a>, and also give me a follow if you’d like! Creating this vision board was a very gratifying and empowering experience for me, so I hope you guys will try this out.
