Despite the global pandemic and having mostly online classes, I am really looking forward to going back to college. My favorite thing about back to school season is that it’s a great opportunity to reinvent myself for the upcoming school year. Part of that process for me is putting together some cute back to school outfits. These are just a few of the looks I’ve come up with so far:

This outfit will definitely be my go to for socially distanced hangouts this fall because I know it will look really good with a black mask! To create this look, I layered a black mesh shirt over a black lace top and tucked it into wide-legged jean capris that I thrifted from Rumours in NC. I then belted this look with a chunky black and gold statement belt. I added gold hoop earrings to match the belt, and a black headband to pull the look together. I also made sure to wear a bold red lip, adding a pop of color to my look. This outfit wouldn’t be complete without some cool shoes, so I have on my Doc Martens (not pictured).

Recently, I’ve gotten really into flare pants; they’re super comfy and flattering in my opinion, and I’m definitely going to be wearing a lot of them when I go up to college. For this look, I paired some flare jeans with a bright red top. Since the other elements of my outfit are solid colors that lack detailing, I chose jeans with lots of buttons and ties (in the back) to give a bit more character to the look. I tied this outfit together by adding black heels and a black headband. While it is realistic for me to wear heels with this look, I might also pair these jeans with some cute black boots if my feet are hurting.

I’m so excited to wear this look around campus this fall because it is super comfy, but also very stylish. For this look, I paired high waisted corduroy flare pants with a pink cropped tank top. I’ve found that pairing high waisted bottoms with a crop top makes my legs look longer, and can sometimes accentuate my hips. Fun fact about my crop top: I actually cropped it myself and sewed the lettuce edge hem. Keeping with the color scheme, I put on some light pink and orange tennis shoes. Pink and orange is actually one of my favorite color combinations, and it just so happens to be trending right now. To make my outfit a bit more interesting, I added my favorite earrings that I bought from Artists & Fleas Market in NYC. One really cool thing about the acrylic earrings I’m wearing is that they change from green to purple depending on the lighting. If you’re looking for similar earrings, you can search “iridescent acrylic earrings” on Etsy and you’ll find some cute options. To finish this look and create a balanced outfit, I added an orange headband from Anthropologie.
