I’ve always thought making a good first impression on people depends on how you present yourself - and for me  part of that is dressing nicely. So, for every day I had classes last week (which was my first week of classes) I actually got out of my pajamas/workout clothes and changed into a fashionable outfit. I didn’t have school on Monday because of Labor Day, so I’ve only included my looks from Tuesday through Friday in this post.

<p class="lst-item">1. Tuesday</p>

On my first day of classes, I spent most of the day outside doing school work. It was pretty hot out on Tuesday, so I put together an outfit that was summer-y and cute. I started with a basic brown slip dress and brown loafers, and added accessories to dress up the look. I chose a cute polka-dot statement headband to add some flair and a gold necklace and teardrop-shaped earrings to add some class to the look. Of course, this look wouldn’t be complete without a mask, so I’m wearing my black cotton one (wear your masks, people!).

<p class="lst-item">2. Wednesday</p>

Wednesday I had a couple of informal meetings, and it was also my first day of work as a TA, so I decided to wear something a bit more casual. I went with some cute blue jean capris and a red tank top and belted it with a brown snake print belt to match my loafers. Finally, I added small gold hoop earrings (which you can find in my blog post on <a href="https://iwalte01.github.io/fashionisa-blog/How-I-Organized-My-Earring-Collection-for-College/"> jewelry</a>), a thin gold necklace, and my black mask. I’ve never tried a look like this before, but I'm really happy with how it turned out!

<p class="lst-item">3. Thursday</p>

Thursdays are my busiest days of the week, but nevertheless I tried to look cute. One aesthetic I’ve always wanted to try is the Academia aesthetic, so I strived for this when creating my look. I chose my most Academia looking green plaid skirt, and paired it with a black top and a black headband. I then added some Doc Martens and large gold hoop earrings to complete the look.

<p class="lst-item">4. Friday</p>

This is definitely my favorite look of the week because it reminds me of fall! It finally started to cool off outside on Friday, so I layered my long cardigan over my red floral lace top, which I then paired with my favorite black jean skirt. Because it was starting to feel like fall outside, I decided to wear what I consider to be fall colors (i.e. red, brown, black, gold). Keeping to this color scheme, I accessorized my outfit with my brown snake print belt and some edgy gold hoop earrings. Finally, I threw on my Docs (classic me...). 

I hope this inspired you guys to experiment with some new looks even if you’re stuck inside doing online classes!
